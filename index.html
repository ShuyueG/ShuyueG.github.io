  <p> In machine learning, the performance of a classifier depends on both the classifier model and the dataset. For a specific neural network classifier, the training process varies with the training set used; some training data make training accuracy fast converged to high values, while some data may lead to slowly converged to lower accuracy. To quantify this phenomenon, <b>we created the Distance-based Separability Index (DSI), which is independent of the classifier model, to measure the separability of datasets</b>. In this paper, we consider the situation where different classes of data are mixed together in the same distribution is most difficult for classifiers to separate, and we show that the DSI can indicate whether data belonging to different classes have similar distributions. When comparing our proposed approach with several existing separability/complexity measures using synthetic and real datasets, the results show the DSI is an effective separability measure. We also discussed possible applications of the DSI in the fields of data science, machine learning, and deep learning.</p>

  <p>Recently, a number of papers have addressed the theory and applications of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in various fields of image processing. Fewer studies, however, have directly evaluated GAN outputs. Those that have been conducted focused on using classification performance and statistical metrics. In this paper, we consider a fundamental way to evaluate GANs by directly analyzing the images they generate, instead of using them as inputs to other classifiers. <b>We consider an ideal GAN according to three aspects</b>: 1) Creativity: non-duplication of the real images. 2) Inheritance: generated images should have the same style, which retains key features of the real images. 3) Diversity: generated images are different from each other. <b>Based on the three aspects, we have designed the Creativity-Inheritance-Diversity (CID) index to evaluate GAN performance</b>. We compared our proposed measures with three commonly used GAN evaluation methods: Inception Score (IS), Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and 1-Nearest Neighbor classifier (1NNC). In addition, we discuss how the evaluation could help us deepen our understanding of GANs and improve their performance.</p>

<div class="content">
  <p> Recently, deep learning has become much more popular in computer vision area. The Convolution Neural Network (CNN) has brought a breakthrough in images segmentation areas, especially, for medical images. In this regard, U-Net is the predominant approach to medical image segmentation task. The U-Net not only performs well in segmenting multimodal medical images generally, but also in some tough cases of them. However, we found that the classical U-Net architecture has limitation in several aspects. Therefore, we applied modifications: 1) designed efficient CNN architecture to replace encoder and decoder, 2) applied residual module to replace skip connection between encoder and decoder to improve based on the-state-of-the-art U-Net model. Following these modifications, we designed a novel architecture by adding Dual-Channel blocks in the U-Net model, called Dual Channel U-Net (DC-UNet), as a potential successor to the U-Net architecture. We created a new effective CNN architecture and build the DC-UNet based on this CNN. We have evaluated our model on three datasets with tough cases and have obtained a relative improvement in performance of 2.90%, 1.49% and 11.42% respectively compared with classical U-Net, especially, DC-UNet has about 30% parameters of the U-Net. In addition, we introduced the Tanimoto similarity and used it for gray-to-gray image comparisons instead of the Jaccard similarity.</p>

  <p>In the U.S., breast cancer is diagnosed in about 12% of women during their lifetime and it is the second leading reason for women’s death. Since early diagnosis could improve treatment outcomes and longer survival times for breast cancer patients, it is significant to develop breast cancer detection techniques. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can extract features from images automatically and then perform classification. To train the CNN from scratch, however, requires a large number of labeled images, which is infeasible for some kinds of medical image data such as mammographic tumor images. In this paper, we proposed two solutions to the lack of training images. 1)To generate synthetic mammographic images for training by the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Adding GAN generated images made to train CNN from scratch successful and adding more GAN images improved CNN’s validation accuracy to at most (best) 98.85%. 2)To apply transfer learning in CNN. We used the pre-trained VGG-16 model to extract features from input mammograms and used these features to train a Neural Network (NN)-classifier. The stable average validation accuracy converged at about 91.48% for classifying abnormal vs. normal cases in the DDSM database. Then, we combined the two deep-learning based technologies together. That is to apply GAN for image augmentation and transfer learning in CNN for breast cancer detection. To the training set including real and GAN augmented images, although transfer learning model did not perform better than the CNN, the speed of training transfer learning model was about 10 times faster than CNN training. Adding GAN images can help training avoid over-fitting and image augmentation by GAN is necessary to train CNN classifiers from scratch. On the other hand, transfer learning is necessary to be applied for training on pure real images. To apply GAN to augment training images for training CNN classifier obtained the best classification performance.</p>

  <p> The convolutional neural network (CNN) is a promising technique to detect breast cancer based on mammograms. Training the CNN from scratch, however, requires a large amount of labeled data. Such a requirement usually is infeasible for some kinds of medical image data such as mammographic tumor images. Because improvement of the performance of a CNN classifier requires more training data, the creation of new training images, image augmentation, is one solution to this problem. We applied the generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate synthetic mammographic images from the digital database for screening mammography (DDSM). From the DDSM, we cropped two sets of regions of interest (ROIs) from the images: normal and abnormal (cancer/tumor). Those ROIs were used to train the GAN, and the GAN then generated synthetic images. For comparison with the affine transformation augmentation methods, such as rotation, shifting, scaling, etc., we used six groups of ROIs [three simple groups: affine augmented, GAN synthetic, real (original), and three mixture groups of any two of the three simple groups] for each to train a CNN classifier from scratch. And, we used real ROIs that were not used in training to validate classification outcomes. Our results show that, to classify the normal ROIs and abnormal ROIs from DDSM, adding GAN-generated ROIs in the training data can help the classifier prevent overfitting, and on validation accuracy, the GAN performs about 3.6% better than affine transformations for image augmentation. Therefore, GAN could be an ideal augmentation approach. The images augmented by GAN or affine transformation cannot substitute for real images to train CNN classifiers because the absence of real images in the training set will cause over-fitting.</p>

  <p>Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death for women in the U.S. Early detection of breast cancer has been shown to be the key to higher survival rates for breast cancer patients. We are investigating infrared thermography as a noninvasive adjunctive to mammography for breast screening. Thermal imaging is safe, radiation-free, pain-free, and non-contact. Segmentation of breast area from the acquired thermal images will help limit the area for tumor search and reduce the time and effort needed for manual hand segmentation. Autoencoder-like convolutional and deconvolutional neural networks (C-DCNN) are promising computational approaches to automatically segment breast areas in thermal images. In this study, we apply the C-DCNN to segment breast areas from our thermal breast images database, which we are collecting in our clinical trials by imaging breast cancer patients with our infrared camera (N2 Imager). For training the C-DCNN, the inputs are 132 gray-value thermal images and the corresponding manually-cropped breast area images (binary masks to designate the breast areas). For testing, we input thermal images to the trained C-DCNN and the output after post-processing are the binary breast-area images. Cross-validation and comparison with the ground-truth images show that the C-DCNN is a promising method to segment breast areas. The results demonstrate the capability of C-DCNN to learn essential features of breast regions and delineate them in thermal images.</p>

We found that method 2) is ideal for study because the classification accuracy of fine-tuning model was just 0.008 higher than that of feature extraction model but time cost of feature extraction model was only about 5% of that of the fine-tuning model. Then, we used method 2) to classify regions: benign vs. normal, malignant vs. normal and abnormal vs. normal from the DDSM database with 10-fold cross validation. The average validation accuracy converged at about 0.905 for abnormal vs. normal cases, and there was no obvious overfitting. This study shows that applying transfer learning in CNN can detect breast cancer from mammograms, and training a NN-classifier by feature extraction is a faster method in transfer learning.</p>

  <p> Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. It is being effectively treated using the radiofrequency
ablation (RFA) procedure, which destroys culprit tissue and creates scars that prevent the spread of
abnormal electrical activity. Long-term success of RFA could be improved further if ablation lesions can be
directly visualized during the surgery. We have shown that autofluorescence-based hyperspectral imaging
(aHSI) can help to identify lesions based on spectral unmixing. We show that use of k-means clustering,
an unsupervised learning method, is capable of detecting RFA lesions without a <em>priori</em> knowledge of the
lesions’ spectral characteristics. We also show that the number of spectral bands required for successful
lesion identification can be significantly reduced, enabling the use of increased spectral bandwidth.
Together, these findings can help with clinical implementation of a percutaneous aHSI catheter, since by
reducing the number of spectral bands one can reduce hypercube acquisition and processing times, and
by increasing the spectral width of individual bands one can collect more photons. The latter is of critical
importance in low-light applications such as intracardiac aHSI. The ultimate goal of our studies is to help
improve clinical outcomes for atrial fibrillation patients.</p>

  <p>In vivo autofluorescence hyperspectral imaging of moving objects can be challenging due to motion artifacts and to the limited amount of acquired photons. To address both limitations, we selectively reduced the number of spectral bands while maintaining accurate target identification. Several downsampling approaches were applied to data obtained from the atrial tissue of adult pigs with sites of radiofrequency ablation lesions. Standard image qualifiers such as the mean square error, the peak signal-to-noise ratio, the structural similarity index map, and an accuracy index of lesion component images were used to quantify the effects of spectral binning, an increased spectral distance between individual bands, as well as random combinations of spectral bands. Results point to several quantitative strategies for deriving combinations of a small number of spectral bands that can successfully detect target tissue. Insights from our studies can be applied to a wide range of applications.</p>

  <p>Firstly, we applied the X-ray non-destructive testing technology to detect wood defects for
getting the images. After graying the images, we calculated their GLCMS(Gray Level Cooccurrence Matrixes), then we normalized GLCMS to obtain the joint probabilities of GLCMS. The feature vectors of images, which included 13 eigenvalues of images were
calculated and extracted by the joint probability of GLCMS. The fuzzy BP neural
network(abbreviated as FBP) was designed by combining fuzzy mathematics and BP neural
network . And the FBP neural network was regarded as the membership function of feature
vectors, the outputs of the network was regarded as the degree of membership to the feature
vectors in each category. We use the maximum degree of membership method for the pattern
recognition of feature vectors, so the automatic identification and classification for feature
vectors were achieved , and then the automatic identification of wood defects was realized.
By simulated study and training many times, the results shown that the average recognition
success rate of the network was more than 90%, and some FBP networks had an extremely
high recognition success rate to training samples and test samples.</p>

  <p>A Shannon entropy-based image processing approach is introduced and applied to the blockboard
X-ray images obtained from nondestructive scanning. X-ray nondestructive testing technology has been
applied to the detection of internal defects in blockboard. In this paper, we select a probability
distribution function to calculate the Shannon entropy in images processing. And we define a novel
Defect Edge Index (DEI) for analyzing the defect edges in images. Through studying and processing
the DEIs, the defect edges extracting is achieved. Furthermore, a new index E for quality evaluation
was also studied out by the DEIs. The number of E can demonstrate the quality of examined
blockboard. Experimental results display that the image processing method based on Shannon entropy
theory is effective and the quality evaluation index E is accurate. Thus, a promising method for
detecting and analyzing defect edges in blockboard X-ray images is provided.</p>

  <p>The blockboard defects were detected by Hough transform and Minimum-Perimeter Polygons. Xray
nondestructive testing system was used to obtain X-ray blockboard images. The rough binary
images of blockboard were got from X-ray images. An initial area of the blockboard defect was
simplified by Mathematical morphology, and then the edges of the area image were detected by
Minimum-Perimeter Polygons (MPP). Large numbers of lines around the boundary were detected by
Hough transform. The lines data were processed by the mathematics and computer graphics methods.
The results show that the blockboard defects can be described by several certain lines on the screen.
And then, the parameters of lines can be obtained by computers easily. Hence, to defects description,
the method in this paper is much more convenient and faster than the traditional methods.</p>

  <p>Nowadays, nondestructive testing technology is a new subject that has gotten rapid development. Xray
nondestructive scanning technology has been applied to the detection of internal defects in
blockboard for the purpose of obtaining prior information that can be used to arrive at better
production quality. Since producers currently cannot see the inside of blockboard until its faces are
revealed by cutting. Therefore, the recognition of internal defects has become gradually significant.
The traditional Euclidean geometry is not proficient of describing different natural objects and
phenomena. In contrast, fractal geometry and its multifractal extension are new implements which can
be used for describing, processing and analyzing complex shapes and images. A method in blockboard
X-ray image defect detection based on multifractal theory was applied in this paper. The Lipschitz–H&#xF6;lder exponent &alpha; of image was computed first. Then its multifractal spectrum <em>f(&alpha;)</em> was calculated and different image points were classified by analysis of multifractal spectrum <em>&alpha;-f(&alpha;).</em> Experimental results showed that the method based on multifractal theory was effective to detect defects in
blockboard X-ray images. Due to the information of defect, the areas and boundaries was obtained
accurately by this method. Hence, in this paper, a dependable method by applying multifractal theory
in defect detection of blockboard X-ray images was provided.</p>
